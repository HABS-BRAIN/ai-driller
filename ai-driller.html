                <div class="modal-meta">March 15, 2024 • Research Conference</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <p>Three days at the Dagstuhl seminar on Explainable AI for Sequential Decision Making have just ended. Thanks to Abhinav Verma, the experience provided valuable insights into the current state of XAI research and its application to sequential decision-making problems.</p>

                <h2 class="modal-title">Learning by Teaching: Sparse Notes on the Protégé Effect</h2>
                <div class="modal-meta">February 28, 2024 • Education & Teaching</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <div class="quote">"When we teach, we learn." - Seneca</div>
                
                <p>Besides working on my own research, the PhD gave me the chance to teach undergraduate students in various courses. This experience has been transformative, not just for the students but profoundly for my own understanding of the subjects I thought I knew well.</p>
                
                <p>The protégé effect, a well-documented phenomenon in educational psychology, describes how teaching others enhances the teacher's own learning. During my time as a teaching assistant, I discovered that explaining complex concepts forced me to examine my own understanding more critically.</p>
                
                <p>Teaching reinforcement learning concepts to undergraduates, for instance, required me to break down abstract mathematical formulations into intuitive explanations. This process revealed gaps in my own knowledge that I hadn't recognized before. The questions students asked often challenged my assumptions and led me to explore aspects of the material I had previously taken for granted.</p>
                
                <p>Moreover, the act of teaching improved my ability to communicate research ideas clearly and concisely - a skill that proved invaluable when presenting my own work at conferences and in publications. The iterative process of explaining, receiving feedback, and refining explanations mirrors the research process itself.</p>
                
                <p>The bidirectional nature of learning in teaching environments creates a positive feedback loop where both student and teacher benefit. This experience has convinced me that teaching should be an integral part of any research career, not just for the benefit of students, but for the growth of researchers themselves.</p>

                <h2 class="modal-title">Evolutionary Algorithms in a Nutshell</h2>
                <div class="modal-meta">September 10, 2023 • Silvia Tulli • AI Research</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <p>Assisting Stéphanie Doncieux with the practicals on Evolutionary Algorithms over the past few years, I had the chance to learn more about evolutionary algorithms and the DEAP library. I have put together some notes—a high-level summary—with the main terminology and key ideas, which I hope will be useful for newcomers.</p>
                
                <div class="quote">"All species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce." - Darwin</div>
                
                <p>Evolutionary algorithms take inspiration from the Darwinian theory of biological evolution and refer to methods such as mutation, selection, and recombination of solutions to solve optimization problems. An example of an optimization problem can be teaching a simple creature to walk.</p>
                
                <p>The fundamental principles of evolutionary algorithms mirror those found in natural evolution. We start with a population of potential solutions, evaluate their fitness according to some criteria, select the best performers for reproduction, and create new offspring through crossover and mutation operations.</p>
                
                <p>What makes evolutionary algorithms particularly powerful is their ability to explore complex search spaces without requiring gradient information. This makes them suitable for problems where traditional optimization methods struggle, such as discrete optimization, multi-objective optimization, and problems with noisy or discontinuous fitness landscapes.</p>
                
                <p>The practical applications are vast, ranging from neural network architecture search to robotics control, from scheduling problems to artistic generation. The versatility of evolutionary approaches continues to make them relevant in modern AI research, especially when combined with deep learning techniques.</p>

                <h2 class="modal-title">From Reinforcement Learning to Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
                <div class="modal-meta">August 22, 2023 • Machine Learning</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <p>Reinforcement learning boasts a substantial history predating the recent surge in deep learning. Reinforcement learning is learning what to do—how to map situations to actions—so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.</p>
                
                <p>The field has evolved significantly from its early roots in psychology and control theory. Classical reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning and policy gradients provided the theoretical foundation, but were limited by their ability to handle high-dimensional state spaces.</p>
                
                <p>The integration of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning, starting with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), revolutionized the field by enabling agents to learn directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs like images. This breakthrough opened up applications that were previously impossible, from playing Atari games to mastering Go.</p>
                
                <p>Modern deep reinforcement learning continues to push boundaries with advances in sample efficiency, multi-agent learning, and transfer learning. The combination of representation learning with decision-making has created powerful systems capable of learning complex behaviors in simulated and real-world environments.</p>
                
                <p>Looking forward, the field faces challenges in sample efficiency, safety, and interpretability. Understanding how these systems make decisions becomes increasingly important as they're deployed in real-world applications where mistakes can have significant consequences.</p>

                <div class="modal-meta">July 5, 2023 • Robotics Conference</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <p>After being able to take part in a few in-person conferences at the beginning of my PhD, such as AAMAS, attending ICRA 2023 was a refreshing return to collaborative research discussions and networking opportunities that virtual conferences cannot fully replicate.</p>
                
                <p>The Explainable Robotics workshop was particularly timely, addressing the growing need for transparency in robotic systems as they become more prevalent in human environments. The discussions ranged from technical approaches for generating explanations to philosophical questions about what constitutes a good explanation in robotics.</p>
                
                <p>One of the key themes was the multi-modal nature of explanations in robotics. Unlike pure software systems, robots can provide explanations through movement, visual displays, speech, and even physical interactions. This richness of communication channels opens up new possibilities for making robotic behavior more interpretable to human users.</p>
                
                <p>The workshop also highlighted the importance of context in robotic explanations. What constitutes an appropriate explanation varies dramatically depending on the user (expert vs. novice), the situation (emergency vs. routine operation), and the stakes involved (safety-critical vs. convenience applications).</p>
                
                <p>The cross-pollination of ideas between robotics researchers and explainable AI researchers was invaluable. It became clear that robotics presents unique challenges and opportunities for explainability that deserve dedicated research attention.</p>

                <h2 class="modal-title">PhD Done: Leveraging Other Experiences Made It Possible</h2>
                <div class="modal-meta">June 15, 2023 • Personal Reflection</div>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-content">
                <p>The research I discuss in my thesis can be seen as a meta-reflection of my PhD journey. Leveraging other experiences throughout my academic and professional path has been crucial in shaping both my research direction and my approach to problem-solving.</p>
                
                <p>Completing a PhD is not just about conducting research—it's about developing a way of thinking, a methodology for approaching complex problems, and the resilience to persist through the inevitable setbacks and challenges. The interdisciplinary nature of my work in computer science, engineering, and intelligent systems required drawing from diverse experiences and perspectives.</p>
                
                <p>The technical skills learned during coursework and research were only part of the equation. Equally important were the soft skills developed through teaching, collaborating with researchers from different backgrounds, presenting at conferences, and navigating the academic community.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back, every experience contributed to the final outcome. Failed experiments taught me about robust experimental design. Challenging student questions improved my ability to explain complex concepts. Collaborative projects enhanced my teamwork and communication skills. Even the most frustrating moments contributed to building the persistence necessary for long-term research projects.</p>
                
                <p>For future PhD students, my advice is to embrace the full experience. The research is important, but don't neglect the opportunities to teach, collaborate, attend conferences, and engage with the broader research community. These experiences will enrich your research and prepare you for whatever career path you choose to pursue.</p>
