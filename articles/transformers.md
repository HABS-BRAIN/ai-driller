# Attention Models Application in EEG Signal Processing

While working on neuromarker identification through EEG signal processing, we came across attention models. This blog aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current state-of-the-art applications of the attention mechanism in EEG processing.

EEG signals are difficult to work with. They exhibit a high noise-to-signal ratio, substantial variability between individuals, and are continuous in nature. However, when well-interpreted, they become a rich source of knowledge, with main use cases including emotion recognition, subject authentication, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
