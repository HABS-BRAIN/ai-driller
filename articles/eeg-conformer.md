# EEG Conformer: Bridging CNNs and Transformers for Better Brain Signal Decoding

Imagine if we could combine the best of two powerful AI architectures to better understand the complex signals our brains produce. That's exactly what researchers accomplished with the EEG Conformer, a neural network that merges convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformer architectures to decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.

EEG signals capture the electrical activity of our brains through electrodes placed on the scalp. These signals are incredibly complex, containing both spatial information (where the activity occurs) and temporal patterns (how the activity changes over time). For brain-computer interfaces and medical applications, accurately decoding these signals is crucial but challenging.

EEG signals are like trying to listen to whispered conversations in a noisy restaurant—while wearing earplugs. The brain's electrical activity is incredibly subtle, measured in microvolts, and contaminated by everything from eye blinks to muscle movements.

Traditional approaches using CNNs excel at capturing local features in EEG data but struggle with long-term dependencies—those important patterns that unfold over longer time periods. Meanwhile, transformer models, famous for their success in natural language processing, are excellent at capturing these long-range relationships and a growing number of researchers are starting to employ them for EEG signal processing, as we previously mentioned in our previous post: [Attention Models Application in EEG Signal Processing]().

The Three-Stage Pipeline:
* *CNN Module*: First, convolutional layers scan through the EEG data identifying local patterns in both time and across brain regions. Think of it as recognizing individual "words" in the brain's language.
* *Transformer Module*: Next, the transformer takes these local patterns and figures out how they relate to each other over longer time periods. It's like understanding how those "words" form meaningful "sentences" of neural activity.
* *Classifier*: Finally, a simple classifier takes all this rich information and makes the final call about what the brain signal represents.

## Convolution Module Details:
Temporal convolution: learns patterns within each brain region
````
temporal_conv = Conv1D(channels=22, filters=40, kernel_size=64)
````

Spatial convolution: learns how brain regions interact
````
spatial_conv = DepthwiseConv1D(groups=40)
````

The temporal convolution is like having 40 different "detectors," each tuned to find specific patterns in the timing of brain activity. The spatial convolution then asks: "When this pattern appears in one brain region, what happens in the others?"
Self-Attention:
Through self-attention, the transformer creates a dynamic map where each point in the EEG signal can evaluate its relationship with every other point, assigning importance weights based on relevance. This comprehensive cross-referencing enables the detection of subtle long-term dependencies that unfold over extended time periods.
